PROJECT TITLE : A simple currency converter in python.

PROJECT OVERVIEW: This program can convert almost any currency. In this program 
I use an API from https://openexchangerates.org to get the current exchange rates across the world.
The data from open exchanges uses the united state dollars as the base currency.Hence what ever currency that is not USD
is first converted to to the united state dollar before conversion to any other currency.

MOTIVATION : I got inspired to build this program when I was learning about APIs.
What better way to learn than to start applying what is Learnt.

REMARKS : As I develop I plan to make this make a GUI version of this program. I am open to suggestions to make it better

Thanks.
